The protocol for basic use of the audio peripheral is extremely simple:
Just send a Write signal, present data representing the tone you wish it
to sound, and deassert the Write signal. Notably, the value 0 (also 0x0,
binary 0b0000, or octal 0o00) signifies to stop making noise.

This exceptionally simple protocol has been integrated into the macro
assembly language. To use it in a program, simply load the desired value
into the accumulator, then use the "BEEP ACC" macro to send the signal to
to peripheral. Please end this beep after an appropriate delay by using the
same macro to send a zero.
